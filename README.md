# PROG 02: Represent!

This app is designed to bring the latest presidential news to the voters. You can enter the location you want to gain more insight into on your phone and see senators and a representative from the selected location with interesting information about them. You can also access part of this information on your smart watch and look at the 2012 voting results for the selected representatives area. Don't forget to shake your watch when you're done.
